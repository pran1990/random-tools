1. neat little tool harlowja made, 
    o this can copy code u are working on to a remote machine - aka a vm,
      upload that code to it as a tarball, extract the tarball, then run tox 
      in that code), it pipes the correct stdout/stderr from the remote tox 
      run into your local terminal (so it looks like it runs locally),
      probably useful for praneshp to run code from his mac to say
